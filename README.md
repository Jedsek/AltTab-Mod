# AltTab Mod

This extension adds navigation with `WASD` and `hjkl` to the `Alt/Super`+`Tab` popup. It changes `Alt/Super`+`Q` to close a window (instead of the entire application), if a window is selected/highlighted. If an app is activated, only its first window will be raised (instead of all of them). Optionally, only show windows from the current workspace or monitor and remove the slight popup delay.

## Supported GNOME versions

- 3.36

## Installation

You can install it via https://extensions.gnome.org. Alternatively, you can download `alttab-mod@leleat-on-github` and move it to your extensions folder. Local extensions are in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`. After moving the folder to the correct location, restart the GNOME shell (`Alt`+`F2` -> enter `r`. On **Wayland** you need to logout).
